<h1>Use of NLP Methodologies in predicting Vento bands</h1>

This is a project that I undertook for [Legal Utopia](https://www.legalutopia.co.uk/), whose scope was to investigate the use of NLP techniques in predicting the potential payoffs of certain complaints under English Law. The code, sparse as it was, did not survive, but I am attaching here the final report with all of my findings. The abstract of the report is as follows:

_The problem statement as it pertains to this work is as follows: how can we employ NLP methodologies to predict
which Vento Band a particular case will fall into, from its case summary. Looking at it first as a similarity problem,
we investigate on a small database of case summaries, the usual metrics of similarity coupled with Bag-of-Words and
TD-IDF methodologies as a first step. We then follow this up with a more sophisticated tool of Doc2Vec account for
more nuance and finally complete this programme by repeating the previous exercises with the vectorisation of words
coming from Google’s BERT.
In addition to the previous standard approaches, we also put forward popular learning methodologies, that include
a Naive Bayes’ Classifier, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and Multilayered Perceptron, finally concluding
with recommending the state-of-the-art in NLP methodology for this task._
